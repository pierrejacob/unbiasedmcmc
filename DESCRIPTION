Description: This package includes the scripts to reproduce the article
    "Unbiased Markov chain Monte Carlo with couplings" by Pierre E. Jacob, John
    O'Leary, Yves F. Atchade, where it is described how the bias of MCMC can
    be exactly removed, using couplings of Markov chains. The technical report
    is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03625.
