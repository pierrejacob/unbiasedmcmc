Description: This package includes the scripts to reproduce the article
    "Debiasing Markov chain Monte Carlo with couplings" by Pierre E. Jacob, John
    O'Leary, Yves F. Atchade, where it is described how the bias of MCMC can
    be exactly removed, using couplings of Markov chains. Illustrations include
    Metropolis--Hastings and Gibbs samplers, with applications to approximation of
    the cut distribution.
